# nest-and-bull-microservices
A system that calculates the Nth prime number for each job and stores the results in a shared database.â€¨

includes 4 containers:
- **app-server**: NestJS controller to create jobs, get job's status, and cancel jobs.
- **worker**: A Bull queue consumer in separate Micro-Service(NestJS) that processes the tasks.
- **mongodb**: Shared database to store job details and results.
- **redis**: Data store used by the Bull queue, serve producers and consumers.

## Quick Start
  
1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and make sure it is running in the system background.

2. Fetch the code
 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/evgi99/nest-and-bull-microservices.git
```

3. Running all services (detach mode)

```bash
$ cd nest-and-bull-microservices
$ docker-compose up -d 
```

4. Check everything is running (list running processes):
```bash
$ docker ps 

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                   .....    PORTS                              NAMES
